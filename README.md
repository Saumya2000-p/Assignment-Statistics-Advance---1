1. Explain the properties of the F-distribution. 
2. In which types of statistical tests is the F-distribution used, and why is it appropriate for these tests?
3. What are the key assumptions required for conducting an F-test to compare the variances of two populations? 
4. What is the purpose of ANOVA, and how does it differ from a t-test? 
5. Explain when and why you would use a one-way ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests when comparing more than two groups.
6. Explain how variance is partitioned in ANOVA into between-group variance and within-group variance. How does this partitioning contribute to the calculation of the F-statistic?
7. Compare the classical (frequentist) approach to ANOVA with the Bayesian approach. What are the key differences in terms of how they handle uncertainty, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing?
8. Question: You have two sets of data representing the incomes of two different professions:
•	Profession A: [48, 52, 55, 60, 62]
•	Profession B: [45, 50, 55, 52, 47] Perform an F-test to determine if the variances of the two professions' incomes are equal. What are your conclusions based on the F-test?
Task: Use Python to calculate the F-statistic and p-value for the given data.
Objective: Gain experience in performing F-tests and interpreting the results in terms of variance comparison.
9. Question: Conduct a one-way ANOVA to test whether there are any statistically significant differences in average heights between three different regions with the following data:
•	Region A: [160, 162, 165, 158, 164]
•	Region B: [172, 175, 170, 168, 174]
•	Region C: [180, 182, 179, 185, 183]
•	Task: Write Python code to perform the one-way ANOVA and interpret the results.
•	Objective: Learn how to perform one-way ANOVA using Python and interpret F-statistic and p-value.
